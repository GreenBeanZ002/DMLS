# DMLS — Duper's Mod for Lazy Staff

DMLS is a client-only Fabric mod for Stoneworks staff workflows on Minecraft 1.21.11. It sends privileged commands but never grants or detects server permission.

## Install and configure

1. Install Fabric Loader, Fabric API, and this mod's JAR on the client. Mod Menu is optional.
2. Start Minecraft once to create `config/dmls.properties`. `play.stoneworks.gg` is allowed by default.
3. Select a staff rank in Mod Options or with `/dmls rank`. This selection only controls which modules DMLS displays. The server remains authoritative and may reject every command.
4. Put alert words, one per line, in `config/dmls-alerts.txt`, then run `/dmls alerts reload`.

Allowlist matching is case-insensitive, normalizes the default port, supports exact hosts, and supports only explicit `*.` subdomain rules. Substring matching is not used. Privileged queues re-check the current connection before each command and cancel on disconnect or server change.

## Commands

The canonical command root is `/dmls`:

- `/dmls lands <ign...>`
- `/dmls members <land>`
- `/dmls alts <ign>`
- `/dmls uuid <username...>` — accepts up to 10 comma/space-separated names through Mojang's bulk API
- `/dmls xray <ign>` and `/dmls xray cancel`
- `/dmls prefix <ign> <limit> <prefixid> <prefixtext>`
- `/dmls donorpet <ign> <pet>`
- `/dmls promowave <rank> <ign...>`
- `/dmls demowave <rank> <ign...>` — removes the given staff rank from every listed player
- `/dmls activity <ign...>` — runs `/activity` for every listed staff member and summarizes the hours, sorted
- `/dmls alerts [on|off|reload]`
- `/dmls chatlog [filter]` — scrollable log of this session's chat, filterable by player or text
- `/dmls greet <ign>` — sends the public welcome message; the greeter module offers this as a click when someone joins for the first time
- `/dmls loc <save|tp|del|list> [name]` — saves named locations client-side (stored in `config/dmls-locations.properties`) and teleports back via `/tp x y z`
- `/dmls co` — opens a form that composes CoreProtect lookup/rollback/restore commands with validation and a live preview
- `/dmls containers <ign|*> <time> <radius>` — runs a CoreProtect container lookup around you, chains through the result pages, and summarizes who took and added what
- `/dmls griefs <ign|*> <time> <radius>` — same as containers, but for block activity: summarizes who broke and placed what
- `/dmls punish` — searchable rulebook browser with each rule's ban ladder, plus a ban-log composer that copies the Stoneworks ban format to the clipboard
- `/dmls brb <duration|off>` — auto-replies to private messages while you are AFK, e.g. `5m`, `30s`, `1h`
- `/dmls dnd <on|off>` — auto-replies that you are busy until turned off
- `/dmls say [reply]`
- `/dmls rank [rank]`
- `/dmls dryrun <on|off>` — prints every DMLS command instead of running it, for safe testing; not persisted, resets on restart. Menu-based checks (lands, members) time out in dry run since no menu opens.
- `/dmls help`


## Development

Java 21 is required. Run:

```text
./gradlew clean test
./gradlew build
```

CI validates the Gradle wrapper, builds, tests, and uploads test reports on failure. The produced mod is client-only and packages `LICENSE.txt`.
